Problem is caused as when a guess is removed that isn't the last guess,
the indicies for the remaining guesses are not updated (and can't easily
be as they are used as the id for the svg element). To fix, use
coordinates as the id as then each is ambiguous and use a fn() to remove
the element with matching coords (Removes need for idx in GuessObj too)

Also, !#1, but use W3C DOM methods for SVG? Or stick with current dodgy
version?
